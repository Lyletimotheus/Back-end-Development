1. php <name_of_php_file> : print the output to the console
2. php -S localhost:<any_port_number> : start up a local server on our machine
3. We can reference a variable also in curly braces : echo "Hello, {$name}";
4. Calling a static method we use the colon, ie. Connection::make(); -> Here we are calling the Connection class with the make method which is a static function
